\arguments{
\item{-}{polygon: either a data.frame with column names lat/lon, SpatialPolygons object,
well-known text string, or extent from raster package. If the object contains
multiple polygons, the union of them is used.  Information from each individal
polygon can be retrieved by returning spatial data and using
the over function from the sp package}

\item{-}{month_day_start: character string of the first month and day for which you want to retrieve data,
in the form: MM-DD.  This is the start of your date range. e.g. '07-01' (July 1) (required)}

\item{-}{month_day_end: character string of the last month and day for which you want to retrieve data,
in the form: MM-DD.  This is the end of your date range. e.g. '07-01' (July 1) (required)}

\item{-}{year_start: character string of the starting year (inclusive) of the range of years for which
you're calculating norms, in the form YYYY. e.g., 2008 (required)}

\item{-}{year_end: character string of the last year (inclusive) of the range of years for which
you're calculating norms, in the form YYYY. e.g., 2015 (required)}

\item{-}{propertiesToInclude: character vector of properties to retrieve from API.  Valid values are accumulations, gdd, pet, ppet, accumulatedGdd, accumulatedPrecipitation, accumulatedPet, accumulatedPpet (optional)}

\item{-}{exclude_year: Year or years which you'd like to exclude from
 your range of years on which to calculate norms. To exclude
 multiple years, provide a vector of years. You must include
at least three years of data with which to calculate the norms. (numeric, optional)}

\item{-}{accumulation_start_date: Allows the user to start counting accumulations from
before the specified start date (or before the
planting date if using the most recent planting).
Use this parameter to specify the date from which
you wish to start counting, in the form: YYYY-MM-DD.
The daily values object
will still only return the days between the start
and end date. This date must come before the start date. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_method: There are variety of equations available for calculating growing degree-days.
Valid entries are: 'standard', 'modifiedstandard', 'min-temp-cap', 'min-temp-constant'
See the API documentation for a description of each method.  The standard
method will be used if none is specified. (character - optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_base_temp: The base temp to use for the any of the GDD equations. The default value of 10 will
be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_min_boundary: The minimum boundary to use in the selected GDD equation.
The behavior of this value is different depending on the equation you're using
The default value of 10 will be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_max_boundary: The max boundary to use in the selected GDD equation. The
behavior of this value is different depending on the equation you're using.
The default value of 30 will be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{includeFeb29thData: Whether to keep data from Feb 29th on leap years.  Because weather/agronomics
summary statistics are calculated via the calendar date and 3 years are required
to generate a value, data from this date is more likely to be NA.  ALlows user
to drop this data to avoid later problems (defaults to TRUE)}

\item{-}{keyToUse: aWhere API key to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{secretToUse: aWhere API secret to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{tokenToUse: aWhere API token to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{numcores: number of cores to use in parallel loop. To check number of available cores: parallel::detectCores().
If you receive an error regarding the speed you are making calls, reduce this number}

\item{-}{bypassNumCallCheck: set to TRUE to avoid prompting the user to confirm that they want to begin making API calls}

\item{-}{returnSpatialData: returns the data as a SpatialPixels object.  Can be convered to raster with the command raster::stack
NOTE: if multiple days worth of data is returned, it is necessary to subset to specific day for working with
as spatial data (sp package: optional)}

\item{-}{keyToUse: aWhere API key to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{secretToUse: aWhere API secret to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{tokenToUse: aWhere API token to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

data.frame of requested data for dates requested

\description{
\code{agronomic_norms_area} pulls long term norm weather data from aWhere's API based on a data.frame of lat/lon, polygon or extent
}
\details{
This function allows you to calculate the averages for agronomic attributes
across any range of years for which data are available.  The data pulled includes norms for
growing degree days (GDDs), potential evapotranspiration (PET), Precipitation over
potential evapotranspiration (P/PET), accumulated GDDs, accumulated precipitation,
accumulated PET, and accumulated P/PET, along with the standard deviations
for these variables.  The data pulled is for the polygon or extent.  The polygon should be either
a SpatialPolygons object or a well-known text character string or an extent.
Default units are returned by the API.

The data returned in this function
allow you to compare this year or previous years to the long-term normals, calculated as
the average of those agronomic conditions on that day in that location over the years specified.

Note about dates: The system does not adjust for any difference in dates between the location of the user
          and where data is being requested from.  It is the responsibility of the user to ensure a valid
          date range is specified given any differences in timezone.  These differences can have implications
          for whether a given date should be requested from the daily_observed functions or the forecast functions.
          Furthermore, because this function can take as input locations that may be in different timezones, it is
          the responsibility of the user to either ensure that the date range specified is valid for all relevant
          locations or to break the query into pieces.
