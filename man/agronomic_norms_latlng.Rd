}
\arguments{
\item{-}{latitude: the latitude of the requested location (double, required)}

\item{-}{longitude: the longitude of the requested locations (double, required)}

\item{-}{monthday_start: character string of the first month and day for which you want to retrieve data,
in the form: MM-DD.  This is the start of your date range. e.g. '07-01' (July 1) (required)}

\item{-}{monthday_end: character string of the last month and day for which you want to retrieve data,
in the form: MM-DD.  This is the end of your date range. e.g. '07-01' (July 1) (required)}

\item{-}{year_start: character string of the starting year (inclusive) of the range of years for which
you're calculating norms, in the form YYYY. e.g., 2008 (required)}

\item{-}{year_end: character string of the last year (inclusive) of the range of years for which
you're calculating norms, in the form YYYY. e.g., 2015 (required)}

\item{-}{propertiesToInclude: character vector of properties to retrieve from API.  Valid values are accumulations, gdd, pet, ppet, accumulatedGdd, accumulatedPrecipitation, accumulatedPet, accumulatedPpet (optional)}

\item{-}{exclude_year: Year or years which you'd like to exclude from
 your range of years on which to calculate norms. To exclude
 multiple years, provide a vector of years. You must include
at least three years of data with which to calculate the norms. (numeric, optional)}

\item{-}{accumulation_start_date: Allows the user to start counting accumulations from
before the specified start date (or before the
planting date if using the most recent planting).
Use this parameter to specify the date from which
you wish to start counting, in the form: YYYY-MM-DD.
The daily values object
will still only return the days between the start
and end date. This date must come before the start date. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_method: There are variety of equations available for calculating growing degree-days.
Valid entries are: 'standard', 'modifiedstandard', 'min-temp-cap', 'min-temp-constant'
See the API documentation for a description of each method.  The standard
method will be used if none is specified. (character - optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_base_temp: The base temp to use for the any of the GDD equations. The default value of 10 will
be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_min_boundary: The minimum boundary to use in the selected GDD equation.
The behavior of this value is different depending on the equation you're using
The default value of 10 will be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{gdd_max_boundary: The max boundary to use in the selected GDD equation. The
behavior of this value is different depending on the equation you're using.
The default value of 30 will be used if none is specified. (optional)}

\item{-}{includeFeb29thData: Whether to keep data from Feb 29th on leap years.  Because weather/agronomics
summary statistics are calculated via the calendar date and 3 years are required
to generate a value, data from this date is more likely to be NA.  ALlows user
to drop this data to avoid later problems (defaults to TRUE)}

\item{-}{keyToUse: aWhere API key to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{secretToUse: aWhere API secret to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{tokenToUse: aWhere API token to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\description{
\code{agronomic_norms_latlng} pulls agronomic norm data from aWhere's API based on latitude & longitude
}
\details{
This function allows you to calculate the averages for agronomic attributes
across any range of years for which data are available.  The data pulled includes norms for
growing degree days (GDDs), potential evapotranspiration (PET), Precipitation over
potential evapotranspiration (P/PET), accumulated GDDs, accumulated precipitation,
accumulated PET, and accumulated P/PET, along with the standard deviations
for these variables.  The data pulled is for the latitude and longitude identified.
Default units are returned by the API.

The data returned in this function
allow you to compare this year or previous years to the long-term normals, calculated as
the average of those agronomic conditions on that day in that location over the years specified.
