\arguments{
\item{-}{field_id: the field_id associated with the location for which you want to pull data.
Field IDs are created using the create_field function.(string)}

\item{-}{day_start: character string of the first day for which you want to retrieve data, in the form: YYYY-MM-DD.}

\item{-}{day_end: character string of the last day for which you want to retrieve data, in form: YYYY-MM-DD}

\item{-}{propertiesToInclude: character vector of properties to retrieve from API.  Valid values are temperatures, precipitation, solar, relativeHumidity, wind (optional)}

\item{-}{keyToUse: aWhere API key to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{secretToUse: aWhere API secret to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{tokenToUse: aWhere API token to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\description{
\code{daily_observed_fields} pulls historical weather data from aWhere's API based on field id
}
\details{
This function returns weather data on Min/Max Temperature, Precipitation,
Min/Max Humidity, Solar Radiation, and Maximum Wind Speed,
Morning Max Windspeed, and Average Windspeed for the field id specified.
Default units are returned by the API.

The Weather APIs provide access to aWhere's agriculture-specific Weather Terrain system,
and allows retrieval and integration of data across all different time ranges, long term normals,
daily observed, current weather, and forecasts. These APIs are designed for efficiency,
allowing you to customize the responses to return just the attributes you need.

Understanding the recent and long-term daily weather is critical for making in-season decisions.
This API opens the weather attributes that matter most to agriculture.

Note about dates: The system does not adjust for any difference in dates between the location of the user
          and where data is being requested from.  It is the responsibility of the user to ensure a valid
          date range is specified given any differences in timezone.  These differences can have implications
          for whether a given date should be requested from the daily_observed functions or the forecast functions
