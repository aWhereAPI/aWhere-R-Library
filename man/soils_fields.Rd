\arguments{
\item{field_id}{the field_id associated with the location for which you want to pull data.
Field IDs are created using the create_field function. (string)}

\item{day_start}{character string of the first day for which you want to retrieve data, in the form: YYYY-MM-DD
Defaults to system date if left blank. (optional)}

\item{day_end}{character string of the last day for which you want to retrieve data, in form: YYYY-MM-DD
Returns all available forecast if left blank. (optional)}

\item{block_size}{Integer value that corresponds to the number of hours to include in each time block.
Defaults to a 1 hour block.  This value must divide evenly into 24. (integer - optional)}

\item{useLocalTime}{whether the data specified is the date specified at the location where data is
being requested from or at UTC = 0.  Default is TRUE}

\item{keyToUse}{aWhere API key to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{secretToUse}{aWhere API secret to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{tokenToUse}{aWhere API token to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}
}
\value{
data.frame of requested data for dates requested
}
\description{
\code{soils_fields} pulls forecasted soil temp/moisutre data from aWhere's API based on field id
}
\details{
This function returns today's soil forecast plus the forecast for up to 15 more days. Forecasts are available
in many sizes of hourly blocks, from hourly to daily. The data this function returns is
the soil's temperature and volumetric moisture content for the location specified by field id for multiple depths
Default units are returned by the API. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees.

Note that when block_size = 1 the fields min/max will be NA

The Weather APIs provide access to aWhere's agriculture-specific Weather Terrain system,
and allows retrieval and integration of data across all different time ranges long term normals,
daily observed, current weather, and forecasts. These APIs are designed for efficiency,
allowing you to customize the responses to return just the attributes you need.

Note about dates: The system does not adjust for any difference in dates between the location of the user
          and where data is being requested from.  It is the responsibility of the user to ensure a valid
          date range is specified given any differences in timezone.  These differences can have implications
          for whether a given date should be requested from the daily_observed functions or the forecast functions
