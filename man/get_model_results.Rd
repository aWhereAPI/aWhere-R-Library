\description{
\code{get_model_details} Calls Model Results endpoint of API
}
\details{
Running a model is as simple as requesting its current results. The aWhere platform
will use the information previously provided about a field and planting to generate
the relevant, field-specific information. For growth stage models, the results are
the current stage as well as information about the most recent and next stage.

Important: Models require the use of the Fields and Plantings APIs to store important
information about a field and crop. When a Field is specified for this API, it will
select the most recently created Planting record to retrieve the crop and planting date.
