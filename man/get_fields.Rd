or an empty string to retrieve information on all fields associated
with the user's aWhere API account (string - optional)}

\item{-}{keyToUse: aWhere API key to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\description{
\code{get_fields} calls Get Field Locations Endpoint of API
}
\details{
Fields are how you manage the locations for which you're tracking weather, agronomics,
models, and progress over growing seasons in the aWhere API. By registering a field, you create a quick way
to consistently reference locations across all of our APIs, and allow our modeling APIs
to better operate and tune to the conditions and status of each specific field.

Before using aWhere's APIs you'll need to register the field locations.
This is a one-time step. Every field has an ID that you define, plus a latitude and longitude.
Fields are universal across all of our APIs, and as you provide information about a field, some APIs
(such as agronomics and models) can leverage that detail internally to more easily and seamlessly
calculate information for you.
