\arguments{
\item{-}{latitude: the latitude of the requested location (double)}

\item{-}{longitude: the longitude of the requested locations (double)}

\item{-}{day_start: character string of the first day for which you want to retrieve data, in the form: YYYY-MM-DD
Defaults to system date if left blank. (optional)}

\item{-}{day_end: character string of the last day for which you want to retrieve data, in form: YYYY-MM-DD
Defaults to system date + 7 if left blank. (optional)}

\item{-}{block_size: Integer value that corresponds to the number of hours to include in each time block.
Defaults to a 1 hour block.  This value must divide evenly into 24. (integer - optional)}

\item{-}{keyToUse: aWhere API key to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{secretToUse: aWhere API secret to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\description{
\code{forecasts_latlng} pulls historical weather data from aWhere's API based on latitude & longitude
}
\details{
This function returns today's forecast plus the forecast for up to 7 more days. Forecasts are available
in many sizes of hourly blocks, from hourly to daily. The data this function returns is
Min/Max Temperature, Precipitation Amount, Chance of Precipitation,
Max Humidity, Relative Humidity, Solar Radiation, Average Wind Speed, Max Windspeed, Percentage
of Sky Covered by Clouds, and Percentage of Clear Sky for the location specified by latitude and longitude.
Default units are returned by the API. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees.

The Weather APIs provide access to aWhere's agriculture-specific Weather Terrain system,
and allows retrieval and integration of data across all different time ranges long term normals,
daily observed, current weather, and forecasts. These APIs are designed for efficiency,
allowing you to customize the responses to return just the attributes you need.
