\description{
\code{current_conditions_latlng} calls Current Weather Conditions Endpoint of API using Lat/Lon
}
\details{
The Weather APIs provide access to aWhere's agriculture-specific Weather Terrain system,
and allows retrieval and integration of data across all different time ranges long term normals,
daily observed, current weather, and forecasts. These APIs are designed for efficiency,
allowing you to customize the responses to return just the attributes you need.

Forecasts are useful for predicting today's weather at the start of the day, but conditions
can change quickly. At that point, having a more recent reading of the area's weather is key
for making decisions in the middle of the day. The Current Weather Conditions, or Nowcast,
API provides the current conditions. This API uses the data from the nearest weather station
that is capable of hourly updates.  Uses the Lat/Lon construct for requesting data.
Uses default units returned by the API
