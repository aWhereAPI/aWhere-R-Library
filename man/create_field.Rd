\description{
\code{create_field} This function will generate a new field associated with the user's account in the aWhere API.
  This is a one-time operation for each field.
}
\details{
Fields are how you manage the locations for which you're tracking weather, agronomics,
models, and progress over growing seasons in the aWhere API. By registering a field, you create a quick way
to consistently reference locations across all of our APIs, and allow our modeling APIs
to better operate and tune to the conditions and status of each specific field.

Creating a field registers the location with the aWhere system, making it easier to reference
and track your locations as well as run agronomics and models automatically. You
only need to create a field once, after which you can reference the field by ID
(you'll use this ID in most URI endpoints in the aWhere system).

All spaces will be converted to underscores to conform with the requirements of the API.
