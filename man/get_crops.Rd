\description{
\code{get_crops} Calls Crops endpoint of API
}
\details{
Models are designed for specific crops, and often specific types or varieties of crops.
This API provides the list of available crops. When creating a planting record, you're encouraged
to specify the crop that is planted in the field using these records.

Within each category of crop (organized by name), there is a default crop. When creating a planting,
you may not know or care about the specific variety, and can simply specify the crop name as
what is planted there. When you do this, the system will use the default crop for that category.
You'll know which crop record is the default by referencing the isDefaultForCrop property, described below.
