\usage{
weather_norms_area(polygon, monthday_start, monthday_end, year_start, year_end,
  propertiesToInclude = "", exclude_years = NULL,
  includeFeb29thData = TRUE, numcores = 2, bypassNumCallCheck = FALSE,
  keyToUse = awhereEnv75247$uid, secretToUse = awhereEnv75247$secret,
  tokenToUse = awhereEnv75247$token)
}
\arguments{
\item{-}{polygon: either a SpatialPolygons object, well-known text string, or extent from raster package}

\item{-}{monthday_start: character string of the first month and day for which you want to retrieve data,
in the form: MM-DD.  This is the start of your date range. e.g. '07-01' (July 1) (required)}

\item{-}{monthday_end: character string of the last month and day for which you want to retrieve data,
in the form: MM-DD.  This is the end of your date range. e.g. '07-01' (July 1) (required)}

\item{-}{year_start: character string of the starting year (inclusive) of the range of years for which
you're calculating norms, in the form YYYY. e.g., 2008 (required)}

\item{-}{year_end: character string of the last year (inclusive) of the range of years for which
you're calculating norms, in the form YYYY. e.g., 2015 (required)}

\item{-}{propertiesToInclude: character vector of properties to retrieve from API.  Valid values are meanTemp, maxTemp, minTemp, precipitation, solar, maxHumidity, minHumidity, dailyMaxWind (optional)}

\item{-}{exclude_year: Year or years which you'd like to exclude from
 your range of years on which to calculate norms. To exclude
 multiple years, provide a vector of years. You must include
at least three years of data with which to calculate the norms. (numeric, optional)}

\item{-}{includeFeb29thData: Whether to keep data from Feb 29th on leap years.  Because weather/agronomics
summary statistics are calculated via the calendar date and 3 years are required
to generate a value, data from this date is more likely to be NA.  ALlows user
to drop this data to avoid later problems (defaults to TRUE)}

\item{-}{numcores: number of cores to use in parallel loop. To check number of available cores: parallel::detectCores().
If you receive an error regarding the speed you are making calls, reduce this number}

\item{-}{bypassNumCallCheck: set to TRUE to avoid prompting the user to confirm that they want to begin making API calls}

\item{-}{keyToUse: aWhere API key to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{secretToUse: aWhere API secret to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\item{-}{tokenToUse: aWhere API token to use.  For advanced use only.  Most users will not need to use this parameter (optional)}

\description{
\code{weather_norms_area} pulls long term norm weather data from aWhere's API based on latitude & longitude
}
\details{
This function allows you to calculate the averages for weather attributes
across any range of years for which data are available.  The data pulled includes
meanTemp, maxTemp, minTemp, precipitation average, solar radiation average,
minHumidity, maxHumidity, maxWind and averageWind, along with the standard deviations
for these variables.  The data pulled is for the latitude & longitude identified.

The data returned in this function
allow you to compare this year or previous years to the long-term normals, calculated as
the average of those weather conditions on that day in that location over the years specified.
